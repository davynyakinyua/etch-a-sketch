It is a drawing toy

only Flexbox in CSS has been used to make the grid. 
Based on the knowledge I posses now, it has been an almost 
impossible task to form a grid just using flexbox. If a grid is formed
with a specific number of squares, when that number changes then the grid 
looses its form and the squares overflow.
